# CS50 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python

This repository contains my completed projects from Harvard's CS50 AI course. Having previously worked with embeddings, vector operations, and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) in production software, I took this course to formalize my understanding of AI fundamentals and fill in the theoretical gaps in my knowledge.

## 🎯 Course Overview

CS50 AI explores the concepts and algorithms at the foundation of modern artificial intelligence, diving into the ideas that give rise to technologies like game-playing engines, handwriting recognition, and machine translation. Through hands-on projects, I implemented:

- **Search Algorithms** - BFS, DFS, A* search, and minimax with alpha-beta pruning
- **Knowledge Representation** - Propositional logic and inference algorithms
- **Uncertainty** - Bayesian networks and probabilistic reasoning
- **Optimization** - Constraint satisfaction and local search
- **Machine Learning** - Supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and classification
- **Neural Networks** - Deep learning architectures for computer vision
- **Natural Language Processing** - Parsing, semantics, and language models

## 💡 Key Takeaways

### Bridging Theory and Practice

Before this course, I had applied ML concepts pragmatically—implementing vector embeddings for semantic search, building RAG pipelines, and working with similarity metrics. CS50 AI gave me the theoretical foundation to understand *why* these techniques work:

- **Search algorithms** clarified how optimization problems are solved systematically, connecting to hyperparameter tuning strategies I've used
- **Bayesian reasoning** formalized my intuitions about uncertainty in model predictions
- **The mathematics behind neural networks** demystified the black box of deep learning models I'd previously used via APIs

### From Consumer to Creator

The course shifted my perspective from *using* AI tools to *understanding* how to build them from scratch. Implementing minimax for game-playing, creating neural networks without high-level frameworks, and building parsers for natural language gave me confidence to approach novel AI problems independently.

### Algorithmic Thinking

Each project reinforced problem decomposition and algorithmic design—skills that apply far beyond AI. Whether optimizing a crossword solver or implementing reinforcement learning for Nim, the structured approach to problem-solving has already improved how I architect solutions in my day-to-day work.

## 🚀 Applying This Knowledge

### Immediate Applications

1. **Enhanced RAG Systems** - Understanding search algorithms and knowledge representation will help me build more sophisticated retrieval mechanisms and knowledge graphs
2. **Custom Model Fine-tuning** - Neural network fundamentals enable me to fine-tune models more effectively rather than treating them as black boxes
3. **Intelligent Agents** - The reinforcement learning and optimization concepts open doors to building autonomous systems and decision-making agents

### Long-term Goals

- **Contribute to open-source AI projects** with deeper understanding of underlying algorithms
- **Design domain-specific AI solutions** rather than relying solely on general-purpose APIs
- **Bridge the gap between business requirements and technical implementation** by speaking both languages fluently

### Professional Development

This foundation positions me to:
- Evaluate AI/ML solutions more critically in technical discussions
- Prototype AI features independently before involving specialized teams
- Understand and navigate the rapidly evolving AI landscape with first-principles thinking

This course taught me that the same principle applies to AI: understanding comes from implementation.
